File manager: archive files X days older than now
Usage:

python file_manager.py [-x] [number] [-s] [path] [-d] [path]

-x = xdays -- the number of days older than now for archiving the files,
              e.g. xdays = 30 means files created and last modified on 30
              days ago. default value is 30.

-s = source_folder -- to specify the folder where are files you want to
                      archive from. default value is where this file
                      located.

-d = destination_folder -- the folder you want to store the archived file
                           to. default value is ./archived_files
-h = help -- show the usage manual
-t = test -- it will create some test files and testing the functions

Adding to crontab jobs of running on first day of every month:
